# World Weather Analysis
Analysis of world wide weather for vacation choices

### Purpose
This code uses world weather APIs and Google's developer APIs to take user input and find vacation spots with ideal weather. 

### Breakdown

Starting with the Weather Database, this code generates random latitudes and longitudes and finds nearby hotels. The user can start here to get a wide selection of potential cities to visit world wide. 

Next the user will use the Vacation Search. Here they enter their desired temperature range, and the code will generate a subset of our original list that fit the input. From there, you can click on the markers to get some more details, such as current weather description and nearest hotel. 

Finally, the Vacation Itinerary code gives a sample of picking a few nearby cities to travel between. The google maps API generates directions, and markers that give relevant info. The user can update the code by desired cities, but this is a great jumping off point for a future app for travel itineraries.
